As of November 24th 2011 the Visual Studio 2008 files are no longer supported.
All files are being move up to Visual Studio 2010. The files in this directory are copies of the files when they were last used.
These files may not be up to date (and will not be kept up to date), but they are here for reference.

If you have any issues with this change please contact Modulus Support.
